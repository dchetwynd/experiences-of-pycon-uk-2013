This is a presentation that I gave at a meeting of the Python Sheffield user group on 24/09/13. It describes my experiences at the PyCon UK 2013 conference held on 20th - 23rd September 2013 in Coventry.

The Python Sheffield user group meets on the final Tuesday of each month and is open to all levels of Python user, including those who don't currently know the Python language but would like to learn. To find out more, follow @pysheff on Twitter or see the Google group:
